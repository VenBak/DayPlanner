## Day Planner

## Description

The purpose of this project was to develop a day planner using html, css and primarily javascript, which enables the user to see the current date and a description of the hours remaining. The user can then type in tasks for hour slots and they are saved if the page is refreshed. My motivation behind this homework was to push my capabilities with javascript and further my knowledge with the language and be able to break down what you want to happen into steps which I know are possible but I had yet to discover how to implement. The Day Planner solves the problem of dynamically change the attributes of elements based on a value which in this case is the time. I learned many things but especially breaking down the major steps and working in sessions to solve minor parts of the overall puzzle. As well as using iterations to select specific elements quicker combined with storing in the local storage.
